# GJK nesterov accelerated

An faster implementaion of the [GJK algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert%E2%80%93Johnson%E2%80%93Keerthi_distance_algorithm) based on the paper  
[Collision Detection Accelerated: An Optimization Perspective ](https://lmontaut.github.io/nesterov-gjk.github.io/) written in rust.

This is an extension to the [collision crate](https://docs.rs/collision/latest/collision/) which is based on [cgmath](https://docs.rs/cgmath/latest/cgmath/).
